# microsoft-planner-mcp

Lightweight MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Microsoft Planner that uses `az rest` for authentication instead of complex OAuth flows.

## What This Is

A minimal MCP server that enables Claude Code to interact with Microsoft Planner tasks directly. It leverages Azure CLI's existing authentication (`az login`) to make Graph API calls, eliminating the need for app registrations or token management.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **Azure CLI** installed and authenticated:
  ```bash
  az login
  ```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jbeineke-gcw/microsoft-planner-mcp.git
cd microsoft-planner-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage with Claude Code

Add the MCP server to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add microsoft-planner-mcp node /path/to/microsoft-planner-mcp/dist/index.js
```

Or add directly to your MCP settings file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "microsoft-planner-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/microsoft-planner-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Claude Code Agent (Optional)

For enhanced automation, create a Claude Code agent at `~/.claude/agents/microsoft-planner.md` with:

- **Auto-assignment**: Automatically assign tasks to a default user
- **Auto-labeling**: Apply default categories/labels to tasks
- **Status Intelligence**: Infer task bucket and progress from conversation context
- **GitHub Integration**: Include repository links in task descriptions

See the [agent template](https://github.com/vyente-ruffin/microsoft-planner-mcp/wiki/Agent-Configuration) for configuration details.

## Finding Your IDs

To use the MCP tools, you'll need your Planner Plan ID and Bucket IDs:

1. Use `list-plans` to discover all accessible plans and their IDs
2. Use `list-buckets` with your Plan ID to get bucket IDs
3. Or find your Plan ID from the Planner web URL: `https://tasks.office.com/...planId=YOUR_PLAN_ID`

## Finding User IDs for Assignment

To assign tasks to users, you need their Microsoft Graph user IDs:

1. Use `list-group-members` with your Plan ID to get all group members
2. This returns each user's `id`, `displayName`, and `userPrincipalName`
3. Use the `id` value with `update-task`'s `assignUserId` parameter

Example workflow:
```
"Who can I assign tasks to?" → list-group-members
"Assign this task to Joe" → update-task with Joe's user ID
```

## Understanding Category Labels

Planner uses generic category names (`category1` through `category25`) internally, but plans can define custom display labels:

1. Use `get-plan-details` to see the category label mappings
2. The `categoryDescriptions` object shows what each category means in that plan
3. Example: `category1` might be labeled "Bug", `category2` might be "Feature"

This helps when:
- You see a task has `appliedCategories: { category6: true }` and need to know what that means
- You want to apply the correct category based on its label rather than guessing the number

## Example Usage

Once configured, use natural language with Claude Code:

```
"List all my planner plans"
"List all tasks in the planner"
"Create a task called 'Review PR #123' in the backlog bucket"
"Mark task XYZ as complete"
"Add a description with the GitHub PR link to the task"
"Add a checklist with: design, implement, test, document"
"Check off the 'design' item on that task"
"What do the category labels mean in this plan?"
"Who can I assign tasks to?"
"Assign this task to Joe"
"Move this task to the 'In Progress' bucket"
"Add a comment to this task: 'Waiting on API team'"
"Show me the comments on this task"
"Attach this GitHub PR link to the task"
"Create a new bucket called 'Blocked'"
"Show me all my assigned tasks across all plans"
```

## How It Works

This server uses `az rest` to make Microsoft Graph API calls. The Azure CLI handles all authentication, so as long as you're logged in with `az login`, the server can access Planner data your account has permissions for.

All Planner operations that require ETags (update, delete) automatically fetch the current ETag before making changes.
